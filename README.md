# Discount-on-Book-Price
<p>The program must accept two integers&nbsp;<strong>X </strong>and <strong>Y </strong>as the number of books and price of each book as the input. The program must print the total price of the amount&nbsp;after applying the discount based on the below conditions:<br>
-If the number of books is greater than or equal to 2 and less&nbsp;than or equal to 4, then 10 percent is discounted from the total price of the books.<br>
-If the number of books is 5, then 20 percent&nbsp;is discounted from the total price of the books.<br>
-If the number of books is more than 5, then 50 percent is discounted from the total price of the books.<br>
-No discount is applied if none of the conditions matches.</p>

<p><strong>Boundary Condition(s):</strong><br>
1 &lt;= X &lt;= 999<br>
30 &lt;= Y &lt;= 800</p>

<p><strong>Input Format:</strong><br>
The first line contains the value of X and Y separated by a space.</p>

<p><strong>Output Format:</strong><br>
The first line contains the discounted price.</p>

<p><strong>Example Input/Output 1:</strong><br>
Input:<br>
2 30</p>

<p>Output:<br>
54<br>
<br>
Explanation:<br>
There are 2 books and each costs 30.<br>
The number of books is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4.<br>
So 10% discount is applied to the total price 60.<br>
So 54 is printed as the output.</p>

<p><strong>Example Input/Output 2:</strong><br>
Input:<br>
1 300</p>

<p>Output:<br>
300</p>
